Add color for each Phases where if that phase was still not on progress it has no color or just Gray, inside the Circles per phases has icons inside of it

### Planner Response

I have successfully completed all the requested refinements for the "Awarded to" section to align it with the monitoring process and ensure visual consistency across the Add, Edit, and View modals.

**Summary of Completed Work:**
1.  **Alignment**: The "Awarded to" section (Date & Supplier) now uses the standard grid layout in all forms ([AddProcurement.tsx](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/DrPsycho/Downloads/ProcureFlow/src/pages/AddProcurement.tsx:0:0-0:0), `Edit Modal` in [ProcurementList.tsx](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/DrPsycho/Downloads/ProcureFlow/src/pages/ProcurementList.tsx:0:0-0:0), and `View Modal` in [ProcurementDetailsDialog.tsx](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/DrPsycho/Downloads/ProcureFlow/src/components/procurement/ProcurementDetailsDialog.tsx:0:0-0:0)), matching the style of other monitoring fields.
2.  **Logic Update**: Updated the dependency logic so that the "Awarded to" fields are only enabled when the "To OAPIA" (`forwardedOapiDate`) field is filled, properly enforcing the chronological workflow.
3.  **Documentation**: Updated [task.md](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/DrPsycho/.gemini/antigravity/brain/eba6abc7-ff79-40f4-95fb-438977847d63/task.md:0:0-0:0) and [walkthrough.md](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/DrPsycho/.gemini/antigravity/brain/eba6abc7-ff79-40f4-95fb-438977847d63/walkthrough.md:0:0-0:0) to reflect these changes.

I am now ready for your next request. What would you like to work on?
