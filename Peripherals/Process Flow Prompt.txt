Create a complete web-based interactive visualization of the Government Procurement Process based on Republic Act No. 9184 and Republic Act No. 12009 of the Philippines.

The purpose of this web page is to help new BAC employees understand the full procurement process in a simple and visual way.

The output must include:

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

Smooth animations

Hover effects

Step-by-step progression animation

Do not use external frameworks unless necessary. Pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript is preferred.

🎯 OBJECTIVE OF THE WEB PAGE:

The system must visually explain the full procurement process from:

Procurement Planning

Market Research (RA 12009 addition)

Competitive Bidding

Evaluation (LCB / HRB or Value for Money)

Post Qualification

Award and Contract Signing

Project Implementation

Monitoring and Closeout

Alternative Methods

Failure of Bidding

Protest Handling

🎨 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:

Use a horizontal or vertical process flow diagram.

Each stage must be inside a box or card.

Arrows must connect the steps.

When user clicks “Next Step”, the next box should animate (fade in or slide in).

When user hovers over a box:

The box changes color.

A short explanation tooltip appears.

The explanation must be simple and easy English.

Use soft professional colors (blue, gray, light green).

Make it responsive for desktop and tablet.

Include smooth transition animations (CSS transition or keyframes).

📝 CONTENT REQUIREMENTS (Very Important):

Each step must have:

Title

Short explanation (simple English)

What happens in this stage

Who is responsible (HOPE, BAC, TWG, Secretariat)

What happens if problem occurs

Use simple English explanation like this example style:

Example format for each stage:

Title: Procurement Planning
Explanation:
This stage is where the agency identify what they need to buy. The project must be included in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP). If it is not included, it must be amended and approved first.

If problem happens:
If no budget available, process cannot continue. It must coordinate with Budget Office.

⚙ FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS:

Add a progress bar on top.

Add "Next" and "Previous" buttons.

Add animated arrows between stages.

Add branching logic animation for:

Failure of bidding

No bidders

Post qualification failed

Protest filed

Alternative procurement

Add highlight animation when showing:

LCB (Lowest Calculated Bid)

HRB (Highest Rated Bid)

Value for Money evaluation (RA 12009)

📚 LEGAL STRUCTURE TO FOLLOW:

Base the flow on:

Republic Act No. 9184:

Competitive bidding structure

LCB and HRB

Post qualification

Failure of bidding

Alternative methods

Bid security and performance security

Republic Act No. 12009:

Strategic procurement planning

Market research

Value for money concept

Digital procurement

Framework agreements

Risk and performance monitoring

💡 EXPLANATION STYLE REQUIREMENT:

Use simple English. Not very fluent. Not too casual.

Example tone:

"This stage is important because BAC must check if bidder is qualified. If bidder fail in post qualification, BAC will go to next ranked bidder. If no more bidder, bidding will be declared failure."

Do not use deep legal terms.
Make it understandable for new BAC staff.

📦 OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide:

Complete HTML file

Embedded CSS

Embedded JavaScript

All code in one file

With comments explaining each section

Add comments like:

<!-- Procurement Planning Section -->

// Function to animate next stage

🎯 FINAL GOAL:

The web page must act like an interactive learning tool for new BAC employees to understand the full procurement lifecycle under RA 9184 and RA 12009.

Make it professional, clean, animated, and easy to follow.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a web-based interactive BAC procurement learning tool for new employees. The output must be node-based, non-linear, where each node represents a procurement stage.

Requirements
1️⃣ General Behavior

The screen shows a network of nodes representing all procurement steps.

Nodes are clickable.

When a node is clicked:

The node expands or highlights with smooth animation.

A side panel or popup shows:

Title of step

Explanation (simple English)

Who is responsible (HOPE, BAC, TWG, Secretariat)

What to do if a problem occurs

After clicking, allow step-by-step navigation to next logical nodes.

Include animated focus transition from current node to next node.

Non-linear flow: users can explore nodes in any order but guided navigation available.

2️⃣ Visual & UI Requirements

Node style: rounded rectangles or circles with step number + short title.

Hover effect: node changes color and shows tooltip with brief explanation.

Focus effect: when selected, node enlarges slightly, connected nodes animate in.

Connections: arrows or lines showing relationship between nodes.

Responsive: works on desktop and tablet.

Colors: professional palette (soft blue, light gray, green).

Transitions: smooth animations for node expansion, hover, and step movement.

3️⃣ Content Structure
Separate Paths:

SVP (Small Value Procurement) Path

Procurement Planning

Approval of APP & Budget

Method Selection

Award & Contract

Implementation & Monitoring

Post-Procurement Review

Regular Bidding Path

Procurement Planning

Market Research (RA 12009)

Advertisement / Posting (PhilGEPS / portal)

Pre-Bid Conference

Submission & Opening of Bids

Preliminary Examination

Detailed Evaluation (LCB/HRB or Value for Money)

Post-Qualification

BAC Resolution & HOPE Approval

Notice of Award & Contract Signing

Project Implementation

Monitoring & Risk Management

Alternative Methods if Failure

Protest Handling

Project Closeout

4️⃣ Functionality Requirements

Click Node: shows full explanation, who does it, and problems handling.

Next/Previous Node Navigation: move step-by-step along recommended path.

Animations:

Node focus transition (zoom or slide)

Connected nodes fade in or move to highlight relation

Tooltip on Hover: simple summary

Problem Handling Pop-up: shows what happens if there is a failure, e.g., failure of bidding, post-qualification failure, protest, etc.

5️⃣ Content Style

Simple English: not too fluent, not too casual

Example:

Title: Post-Qualification
Explanation: BAC checks if the bidder meets all requirements. If bidder fail, BAC can go to next ranked bidder. If no more bidder, declare failure of bidding.
Responsible: BAC, TWG
Problem: Next ranked bidder or alternative procurement.

Each node must include Title, Explanation, Responsible, Problem Handling.

6️⃣ Technical Requirements

Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla preferred)

Optional: D3.js or Cytoscape.js for node graph visualization and animation

Node information panel can slide in from side or popup

Smooth transitions on focusing and moving between nodes

All code in one file, with clear comments for each section

Include SVP vs Regular Bidding separation visually (e.g., different colors or lanes)

7️⃣ Learning Goals

Tool should help new BAC staff understand:

Steps in procurement lifecycle

Who is responsible for each stage

What to do in case of problems

Focus on interactive and visual learning

Include RA 9184 and RA 12009 principles where relevant

8️⃣ Output Format

Complete HTML file

Embedded CSS

Embedded JS

Ready-to-run interactive node-based flow

Include example content for both SVP and Regular Bidding nodes

Optional Enhancements:

Add progress bar for recommended path

Include animated arrows when moving to next step

Include node legend for SVP vs Regular Bidding

Highlight RA 12009-specific steps (Market Research, Value for Money, Digital Posting)

Goal:

Create an interactive, educational web tool for BAC staff that is visual, non-linear, animated, and easy to understand, showing all steps of procurement with problem handling and role responsibility.

include line connecting to nodes and turn backs if the node has error and go back to the previous nodes, make it in a full view not includin the title is in fixed top bar. for navigations if the node has next lot of process then i just click the node i want to proceed then by next either it proceed down or go up so i can know and visualize the whole of the nodes in a sequential orders. also you can separate the process of SVP and Regular Bidding. to make it in a more detailed and education web app for new comers on the BAC or knowing the processs even in other division other than BAC. make it like a Draw IO dark UI
